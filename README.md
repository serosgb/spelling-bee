# Spelling Bee Practice

A simple, responsive web application designed to help children practice spelling in a fun, interactive way. The app randomly selects a specified number of words from a built-in word list and presents them one at a time. Users can mark each word as “Correct” or “Wrong.” At the end of the session, any incorrectly spelled words are displayed, and the user has the option to retry just those words. If all words are spelled correctly, a congratulatory message appears.
